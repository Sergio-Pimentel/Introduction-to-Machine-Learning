# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
A structured introduction to machine learning, sharing my step-by-step approach to building predictive models with Python.

I cover everything from initial data exploration to model training, evaluation, and validation, using real-world data for practical insights. My goal is to clarify the complete machine learning workflow and demonstrate essential skills using popular libraries.

Throughout the notebook, I cover:

* Loading datasets and initial inspection using Pandas.
* A little bit of (EDA), including statistical summaries and visualizations.
* Data preprocessing techniques: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and feature engineering.
* Splitting data into training and testing subsets - Plus the differences of splitting a timeseries and a "static" dataset.
* Training supervised learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* Model evaluation through accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and cross-validation.
* Techniques for preventing overfitting, including hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search and Randomized Search).
* State of the Art Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna framework
* Interpretation of model outputs, comparison between models, and best practices for model selection.
